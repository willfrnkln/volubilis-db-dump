This is a database dump of the Volubilis Thai-English dictionary.  I removed some of the entries I didn't need, and added IPA pronunciation information using the pythainlp library.

I recently learned that there's another repo on github similar to this one, but in a dictionary format, not a regular database, so I figured I would share this anyways. Feel free to use/edit it as you please.
